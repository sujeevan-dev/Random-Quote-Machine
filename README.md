#Random-Quote-Machine

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/sujeevan81/pen/pwerrN.

 This is my first JavaScript project I created for freeCodeCamp. As I didn't find any API  which could render shakespeare's quotes, I created my own array  which contains quotes in  objects and I randomly shuffle them when the button is pressed.
